

Just some rambling notes I don't want to forget related to the Nutcracker DLL project.


Setting up for CodeBlocks & wxWidgets instructions pretty good.
-just one issue for me: my path had too much 'stuff' in it that confused the wx buld.
-Path=C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\mingw\bin
-then build worked fine


First pass:
-Create an nccdll (Nutcracker core dll) dir under xLights
-Using VS10 to create the dll
-Create sln and vcproj in there along with any other needed stuff
-Add RgbEffects and the RenderXXX files from the parent dir
-Hit build and....
-Use of wxXXX classes needs addressing...
-Also had to use full path to my wx dir in extra cmdline opts... revisit

-First try... reimplement what NC needs...
-create local wx dir in nccdll for re-impl of the wx stuff used.
-Mosly some simple classes easy to re-do.
-Got a build, but had to leave out Pictures and Text for adj wx usage
-Talked to Sean... they have no reason to avoid wx stuff (too bad for me)

-Plan B... try using static versions of wx libs in dll...
-first need to get 32b static libs  (debug/release)
-in wx build/msw dir...
-use Path=C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows  plus  vs10\vc\vcvarsall  (x86 vars)
-nmake -f makefile.vc SHARED=0 UNICODE=1 BUILD=debug
-nmake -f makefile.vc SHARED=0 UNICODE=1 BUILD=release
(apparently monolithic is not advisable with shared=0)
-re-jigger the project to use real includes and libs just built
-got a build...
-massage RgbEffects a bit to tighen up the interface...
